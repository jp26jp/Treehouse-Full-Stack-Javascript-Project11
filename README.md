## Before you start

### Download the project files. We've supplied the following files for you to use:
- The seed-data folder contains seed data for your database that can be used in conjunction with the [mongoimport](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/) command line utility.
- The src folder is where you'll be building your Node.js REST API. We’ve provided some files to get you started.
    - The index.js file configures Express to serve a simple REST API. We've also configured the morgan npm package to log HTTP requests/responses to the console.
    - We’ve included a .gitignore file to ensure that the node_modules folder doesn't get pushed to your GitHub repo.
    - The CourseAPI.postman_collection.json file is a collection of Postman requests that you can use to test and explore your REST API.
    - The nodemon.js file configures the nodemon Node.js module, which we are using to run your REST API.
    - The package.json file is the project’s npm configuration, which includes the project’s dependencies.

### Ensure that you have MongoDB installed.
- Open a Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac OS X) instance and run the command mongod (or sudo mongod) to start the MongoDB daemon.
- If that command failed then you’ll need to install MongoDB.
- How to Install MongoDB on Windows
- How to Install MongoDB on a Mac

### Seed your MongoDB database with data.
- If you haven't already done so, open a Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac OS X) instance and run the command mongod (or sudo mongod) to start the MongoDB daemon.
- Open a second Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac OS X) instance.
- Browse to the seed-data folder located in the root of the project.
- Run the following commands:

```
mongoimport --db course-api --collection courses --type=json --jsonArray --file courses.json
mongoimport --db course-api --collection users --type=json --jsonArray --file users.json
mongoimport --db course-api --collection reviews --type=json --jsonArray --file reviews.json
```

### We’ve provided you with a basic project to get started. When developing your REST API, just add your code to the src folder. You’ll need to run the provided Node.js Express application locally and use Postman to test your REST API.
- Open a Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac OS X and Linux) instance and browse to the root project folder.
- Run the command npm install to install the required dependencies.
- Run the command npm start to run the Node.js Express application using nodemon. Using nodemon gives you the ability to leave your application running while you edit your application’s code (nodemon will restart your Node.js application when it detects that you’ve made changes to your code).
- As you build your routes, you can see what information it sends back with Postman using the preconfigured requests in the collections file included in the project.
- You can press Ctrl-C to stop the Node.js REST API.

### Postman is a great Chrome App that you will use to explore and test REST APIs. To help you jumpstart the exploration process, we’ve provided you with a collection of Postman requests as part of the project files. Here’s how to load the provided collection into Postman:
- If you haven’t already, install Postman. Links and instructions are available on their website at https://www.getpostman.com/.
- Once you have Postman installed and open, click on the “Import” button in the top left hand corner of the application’s window.
- In the opened dialog, click the “Choose Files” button and browse to the folder that contains your project files.
- Select the CourseAPI.postman_collection.json file.
- You should now see the Course API collection in the left hand pane of the main Postman window.
- Click on one of the available requests to load it into a tab. Click on the Request button to issue the request to the local server.
- Be sure that your REST API is currently running (see the previous project step for details).
- When testing for user authorization at GET /api/users, make sure to set Authorization Type in postman to Basic Auth to enter the user's email and password.

### As you build out your REST API, you’ll naturally encounter errors and unexpected behavior. Here are some reminders and suggestions on how to debug your REST API.
- If Node.js crashed as a result of the error, you can look in the Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac OS X and Linux) window and see the exception information.
- Sometimes errors don’t result in exceptions, but instead are returned as 400 or 500 HTTP status codes. Errors returned from your REST API will be logged in Postman.
- For a deeper, more detailed analysis of the state of your application, you can use Google Chrome to debug your Node.js application. Watch the Debugging Node Applications With Google Chrome workshop for more information.

## Project Instructions

### Set up a database connection.
- [x] Use npm to install Mongoose.
- [x] Using Mongoose, create a connection to your MongoDB database.
- [x] Write a message to the console if there's an error connecting to the database.
- [x] Write a message to the console once the connection has been successfully opened.

### Create your Mongoose schema and models. Your database schema should match the following requirements:
User
- [x] _id (ObjectId, auto-generated)
- [x] fullName (String, required)
- [x] emailAddress (String, required, must be unique and in correct format)
- [x] password (String, required)

Course
- [x] _id (ObjectId, auto-generated)
- [x] user (_id from the users collection)
- [x] title (String, required)
- [x] description (String, required)
- [x] estimatedTime (String)
- [x] materialsNeeded (String)
- [x] steps (Array of objects that include stepNumber (Number), title (String, required) and description (String, required) properties)
- [x] reviews (Array of ObjectId values, _id values from the reviews collection)

Review
- [x] _id (ObjectId, auto-generated)
- [x] user (_id from the users collection)
- [x] postedOn (Date, defaults to “now”)
- [x] rating (Number, required, must fall between “1” and “5”)
- [x] review (String)
Mongoose validation gives you a rich set of tools to validate user data. See http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html for more information.

### Create the user routes
Set up the following routes (listed in the format HTTP VERB Route HTTP Status Code):
Users
- [x] GET /api/users 200 - Returns the currently authenticated user
- [x] POST /api/users 201 - Creates a user, sets the Location header to "/", and returns no content

Courses
- [x] GET /api/courses 200 - Returns the Course "_id" and "title" properties
- [x] GET /api/courses/:id 200 - Returns all Course properties and related documents for the provided course ID. When returning a single course for the GET /api/courses/:courseId route, use Mongoose population to load the related user and reviews documents.
- [x] POST /api/courses 201 - Creates a course, sets the Location header, and returns no content
- [x] PUT /api/courses/:id 204 - Updates a course and returns no content
- [x] POST /api/courses/:id/reviews 201 - Creates a review for the specified course ID, sets the Location header to the related course, and returns no content

### Update any POST and PUT routes to return Mongoose validation errors.
- [x] Use the next function in each route to pass any Mongoose validation errors to Express’s global error handler
- [x] Send the Mongoose validation error with a 400 status code to the user

### Update the User model to store the user's password as a hashed value.
For security reasons, we don't want to store the password property in the database as clear text. 
- [x] Create a pre save hook on the user schema that uses the bcrypt npm package to hash the user's password. See https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/ for more information.

### Create an authentication method on the user model to return the user document based on their credentials
- [x] Create a static method on the user schema that takes an email, password, and callback
- [x] The method should attempt to get the user from the database that matches the email address given.
- [x] If a user was found for the provided email address, then check that user's password against the password given using bcrypt.
- [x] If they match, then return the user document that matched the email address
- [x] If they don't match or a user with the email given isn’t found, then pass an error object to the callback

### Set up permissions to require users to be signed in
- [x] Postman will set an Authorization header with each request when a user is signed in. Add a middleware function that attempts to get the user credentials from Authorization header set on the request. You can use the basic-auth npm package to parse the `Authorization' header into the user's credentials.
- [x] Use the authenticate static method you built on the user schema to check the credentials against the database
- [x] If the authenticate method returns the user, then set the user document on the request so that each following middleware function has access to it.
- [x] If the authenticate method returns an error, then pass it to the next function

Use this middleware in the following routes:
- [x] POST /api/courses
- [x] PUT /api/courses/:courseId
- [x] GET /api/users
- [x] POST /api/courses/:courseId/reviews
